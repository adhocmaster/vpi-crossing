Vehicle Interaction with Crossing Pedestrians

## Standard Scenarios
- Euro NCAP: [AEB Pedestrian](https://www.euroncap.com/en/vehicle-safety/the-ratings-explained/vulnerable-road-user-vru-protection/aeb-pedestrian/)
  - The crossing scenarios are: an adult running from the driver’s side of the vehicle; an adult walking from the passenger’s side (two tests are performed for this scenario); and a child runs from between parked cars on the passenger’s side of the car. 
  - In the longitudinal scenario, two tests are done: one with the pedestrian aligned with the centre of vehicle, the other with the pedestrian offset to one side.
  - The longitudinal scenario and one of the crossing scenarios are repeated in low-light conditions, as this is a situation in which many pedestrian accidents occur.
